process - figma prototype(add link) -> frontend -> database -> backend

for databse, used firebase - because generally better for working with other people and security and out of 2 options - choose firestore database.
for example for mysql would need to configure docker as well and would only persist for local user.
could use in memory H2 database but that is comparatively more to set up than firebase
